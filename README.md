# nsCleftLipPalate_EducationalAttainment
Previous studies have found that children born with a non-syndromic orofacial cleft have lower than average educational attainment. 
Differences could be due to a genetic predisposition to lower intelligence and/or academic performance, 
factors arising due to the cleft phenotype (such as social stigmatisation, impaired speech/language development), 
or confounding by the prenatal environment. 

A clearer understanding of this mechanism will inform interventions to improve educational attainment in individuals born with cleft,
which could have major effects on their quality of life. 

In the present project, the hypothesis that common variant genetic liability to non-syndromic cleft lip/palate (nsCLP) influences 
educational attainment. 

We conducted a GWAS meta-analysis of nsCL/P in 1692 cases and 4259 parental and unrelated controls. 
Genetic correlation between nsCL/P, educational attainment and intelligence was estimated using LD Score regression. 
Two-sample Mendelian randomization was performed to examine any causal effects of genetic liability to nsCL/P on educational attainment 
and intelligence.

The present repository contains code for the LDSC and two-sample MR analyses.
